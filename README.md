## GitHub Actions Templates

This repository contains templates for GitHub Actions workflows, aimed at 
making it easier for developers to create and customize their own 
workflows for various tasks.

## Usage

To use a template, simply copy the contents of the template file and paste 
it into your own repository's workflow file, located in 
.github/workflows/. You can then customize the workflow as needed to fit 
your specific needs.

## Available Templates
The following templates are currently available:

build-test-deploy.yml: A workflow that builds, tests, and deploys a 
project to a specified environment.

jmeter-test-deploy.yml: A workflow that tests an application using JMeter, 
and deploys it if the tests pass.

triggered-build.yml: A workflow that triggers a build whenever a new 
commit is pushed to the repository.

scheduled-build.yml: A workflow that runs on a schedule to perform various 
tasks, such as backing up data or running automated tests.

service-containers.yml: A workflow that uses service containers to run a 
Spring Boot application.


##Contributing

If you would like to contribute a new template, or improve an existing 
one, please feel free to submit a pull request! We welcome contributions 
from anyone in the community who would like to help make GitHub Actions 
workflows more accessible and customizable.
